# stellar_kt
Multiplatform Stellar SDK

I am currently aiming to support JS, Native and JVM. 

## What about Soroban?
I am planning to work on Soroban as soon as I finish basic support for creating, signing and submitting transactions.

## Why not use the Java library?
The Java library works fine if you are doing server side or android programming. However I would like to share my Kotlin code between server and a web front-end, as Kotlin also targets the Browser.
